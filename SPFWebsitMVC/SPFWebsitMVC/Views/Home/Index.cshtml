                "My husband and I LOVE team training! Zach helps us do more together than we ever would by ourselves.
                The classes are high energy, fun and intense. I enjoy all the trainers and the team atmosphere adds a
                sense of encouragement and belonging. Each session is strategically different and Zach created a program
                for us to do if the class time doesn't work into our day, so there is always a gameplan. We look forward
                to our workouts for sure!!! Can't recommend it enough." - Shelly
